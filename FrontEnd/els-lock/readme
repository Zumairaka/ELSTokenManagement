=> there 4 functions under App.js and copy the lock contract address on the following comments address space
a. // read locked token balance
b. // prepare send tokens
c. // prepare withdraw tokens

and copy the token address and paste it on address space of
a. // prepare approval tokens

8. upon successful it will show your address and both eth
and token locked balance. Also it will show the send withdraw buttons
9. specify the amount (1 for 1 eth etc as I am doing conversion in frontend) and click send. Give approval and the buttons will keep change based on the status. Also give sometime between approval and sending tokens as it takes sometime to write the approval on mainnet. Otheriwise the txn will throw error.
10. Click send and sign the txn and wait for the confirmation and hash.
11. Mention the amount again for withdrawal and click withdraw.
